# main ideas
- 3x3 grid of parallel tasks (must be configurable in the future)
- should be possible to cancel the execution of an item
- fabric argument list design
- if none arguments was found: import hosts/roles from fabfile.py
- general run button runs all hosts in the page to limit execution to 9
- when a page in finished the other page is runned
